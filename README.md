This is my adaptation of the Google Earth Enginer Python API Tutorial!
I completed this project in hopes to learn more about Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scipy, Folium, and the Google Earth Engine API. Although I was often limited by my current lack of statistics knowledge, I feel I learned a lot. I hope to use everything I learned from this project to complete a small case study of how climate change has affected my community in Boulder, CO. 
Many code snippets are from the [Google Developers Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/intro-to-python-api) written by [guiattard](https://github.com/guiattard) and [mortcanty](https://github.com/mortcanty). More incredible information about the Google Earth Engine can be found at any of these links or on the [Google Earth Engine Website](https://earthengine.google.com/).
